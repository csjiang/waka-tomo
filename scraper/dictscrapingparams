- need to replace malformed < and > in poet name, do global replace with < and > 
- split on <br>　　　: 7 categories for each of 5 seasons- concatenate words together and attach category column to each word - strip these 
- split on seasons? possibly no need to if the season name is in each of the season descriptions - strip these
- word: /<br><b>.+?</g - 412 words
- hiragana: /<span class="ruby">.+</span></b>/g (this is missing a few words, so this property should allow Null- default will set it equal to title?)
- season: /　（.+?）/g (works for all except new year ones) 
- synonyms: /［.+?］/g (some don't have, so this can be null or empty array)
- description: /<br>.*<br>/ - 411 matches- after removing poems and replacing w <br>
- poem: /　　.+?<.+?>.*?<br>/g - 536 matches (plus have to add last one manually) 

todo: 
- assign general seasons to things (perhaps unnecessary if the season name is contained in the subseason; else i can just use a dictionary or say if there is no seaosn to maek it new year)
- assign categories
